# The Chat 3D
The sequel to the "beloved" project "The Chat", a chaotic online chat room that I created to test server-side node js scripts (https://github.com/ItsTheChickenMan/thechat).  This is the 3D interactive version, featuring the old chat you know and love, moving cubes, and broken physics.  This project is a pretty much a joke, but if you're really interested I host the server on:
http://75.133.182.85/

# Installation (for hosting)
If you want to host this yourself, installation is pretty straightforward:

Step 1: clone repo    `$ git clone https://github.com/ItsTheChickenMan/thechat3d`

Step 2: install deps  `$ npm install`

On Linux:

Step 3: run server.js with sudo `$ sudo node server.js`

On Windows:

Step 3: run server.js from shell as administrator `> node server.js`

Note that hosting on Apple hasn't been tested, and will remain that way because I don't have an Apple computer nor do I plan on getting one.  Proceed with caution.

Want to use the c3d engine for your own projects?  don't.  If you want to make a serious project, use something more reliable.  If you want to make something silly or personal, just know that there's no documentation and the engine is really stupid.  There'll be a lot of unnecessary headaches.
